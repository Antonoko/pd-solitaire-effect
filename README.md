Solitaire game winning effect on Playdate

[video]

### how to use

How it works: Create a blank transparent image and keep drawing cards on it. Update the display through sprites. You can place sprites at any layer (Zindex).

Configuration required:
- `playdate.graphics.imagetable` containing all cards
- Coordinates of the positions of several decks to be launched

That's it! I think the code is not complicated,  feel free to use and modify.
